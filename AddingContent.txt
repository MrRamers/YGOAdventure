----What are ydk files----

This game was made with user content in mind, in order to do so we use ydk files. These are files generated by EDOPro (or similar programs) to manage decks.
In other to make a ydk file: open EDOPro -> click "Decks" -> Build your deck -> click "Save".
You will find your ydk file under "C:\ProjectIgnis\deck".
Note: you can add a ydk file to "C:\ProjectIgnis\deck" and edit it using EDOPro.

---Adding/modifying content---

--Adding starter Decks:
    Build the deck using EDOPro and place the resulting file in "..\YGOAdventure\Assets\Resources\StartingDecks".
    Decks are chosen randomly, so removing undesired decks from this folder will remove them from the game.

--Adding Packs:
    Create the pack with EDOPro and place the resulting file in "..\YGOAdventure\Assets\Resources\Packs".
    The pack name in game will be the file name.
    By default, packs will cost 100 and pull 5 cards each time. If the pack name contains "PriceCard", it will cost 300 and only pull 1 card.
    In order to add a cover image for the pack, simply add a png file with the same name as the pack on "..\YGOAdventure\Assets\Resources\PacksImgs".

--Adding Singles:
    Similarly to adding decks, make a list of cards using EDOPro and drop the resulting file in "..\YGOAdventure\Assets\Resources\Singles".
    By default, cards cost 100 and will only add 1 copy to your deck.
